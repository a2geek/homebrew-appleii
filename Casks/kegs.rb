  caveats <<-EOS
    You may launch KEGS by running `kegs` from the terminal.

    Because of macOS security measures, you may have to open KEGSAPP by
    right-clicking on the app in the Finder a couple of times.

    You need to copy ROM files into #{kegs_folder}.

    See #{kegs_folder}/README.mac.txt.
